The CementBloc represents the

culmination of a lifelong dream for

Susan. She spent 12 years as a leader in

the management team at Cline Davis &

Mann (CDM), helping them grow from a

single-client (Pfizer) agency with a staff

of 20 to a multidivisional, $40 millionñ

plus company with over 200 employees

and the 1997 Agency of the

Year award from Med Ad News.<br /><br />



Susanís decision to leave CDM was an

important step in her ultimate plan to

form The CementWorks. To broaden

her exposure in the industry, she

joined Lowe McAdams Healthcare as

managing director in April 1999 and was

promoted to president by yearís end.

Lowe provided the opportunity to work

with new clients (Roche, Schering, Glaxo

Wellcome) in entirely new categories.



Over the years, Susan supervised the

launch or relaunch of 7 of todayís top

50 brands: Lipitor, Viagra, Norvasc,

Zithromax, Neurontin, Diflucan, and

Glucophage. Each of these brands has

achieved sales in excess of $1 billion.

Branding is Susanís forte and passion.



At Lowe, Susan also met her future

partner, Rico Viray. Susanís and Ricoís

desire to focus on branding and core

advertising/promotion businessóand

the potential value of that focusó

became a key insight and the impetus

for founding The CementBloc

(formerly The CementWorks).]]>
